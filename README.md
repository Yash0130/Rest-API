# My First Ever RESTful API (Node.js + Express)

Welcome to my first RESTful API project using Node.js and Express!
This project is designed to help you get started with building a RESTful API using these technologies.

## Overview

This project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to developing RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express. 
You'll learn the fundamentals of routing, handling HTTP methods, and structuring your API.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express**: A javaScript web framework for Node.js, ideal for building robust and scalable web applications and APIs.

## Features

- **Routing**: Define and create routes for different API endpoints.
- **HTTP Methods**: Implement various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations.
- **Middleware**: Utilize Express middleware for request processing and response handling.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run your API:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `npm start`
4. Explore the API using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

## API Endpoints

- **GET /api/resource**: Retrieve a list of resources.
- **GET /api/resource/{id}**: Retrieve a specific resource by ID.
- **POST /api/resource**: Create a new resource.
- **PUT /api/resource/{id}**: Update an existing resource.
- **DELETE /api/resource/{id}**: Delete a resource.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute to the project by submitting issues or pull requests. Your feedback and ideas are highly appreciated.

Happy coding with Node.js and Express!
